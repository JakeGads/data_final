2,Bryce Hawkins, Inc. Magazine's 5000 Fastest Growing Companies, A , I really like how the story each graph segwayed into another and the intelligent use of filters,
3,Eric Kelso, Worker Data, B, the video was a little bit too long maybe limiting the questions you were asking would help, I did like how every dashboard aimed to answer a question and I thought that the questions were well thought out,
4,The first one[no name provided], Taking a Quick HR GLance, B, was a litle long, I liked how completed the data was and how you were able to provide insights with the background that you have
5,Jacob Bernocco, Terrorist Attacks since 1968, A, great data source, I really like the first graph I feel like it showed a lot of information with some great legend and filtering, the background knowledge of the data was great, Very natural flow of the presentations,
