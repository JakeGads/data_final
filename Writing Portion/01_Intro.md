# Intro

In Late April of 2009 [KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com) was founded, it is a website where people can come together to fund projects, monitaraly supporting a project makes you a "backer" and can be given a certain level of rewards from the creators on the site. KickStarter funds everything from video games, to books, to art, and music. If its a project that can be created by a small team it can find a home on KickStarter.

## Issues

It should be stressed that creators on KickStarter are not necessarily professionals (although they can be) and thus projects can be over-ambishish or fall through. After a project is fully funded there are no promises that the creators will go through with their plan 

While I wish that all people were good and that any failed projects are not in that state for valid reasons I am smarter than that I understand that some people do use the site to scam people from their money.

## I hope to find ...

one or more identifiers of if a project will fail, for instance does it's category or sub category affect the projects chances to succeeded, does the location of the project have an impact and can it be negatively affected by amount of funds requested?
